 * halfprecision converts the input argument to/from a half precision floating
 * point bit pattern corresponding to IEEE 754r. The bit pattern is stored in a
 * uint16 class variable. Please note that halfprecision is *not* a class. That
 * is, you cannot do any arithmetic with the half precision bit patterns.
 * halfprecision is simply a function that converts the IEEE 754r half precision
 * bit pattern to/from other numeric MATLAB variables. You can, however, take
 * the half precision bit patterns, convert them to single or double, do the
 * operation, and then convert the result back manually.
 *
 * 1 bit sign bit
 * 5 bits exponent, biased by 15
 * 10 bits mantissa, hidden leading bit, normalized to 1.0
 *
 * Special floating point bit patterns recognized and supported:
 *
 * All exponent bits zero:
 * - If all mantissa bits are zero, then number is zero (possibly signed)
 * - Otherwise, number is a denormalized bit pattern
 *
 * All exponent bits set to 1:
 * - If all mantissa bits are zero, then number is +Infinity or -Infinity
 * - Otherwise, number is NaN (Not a Number)
